# ASCII ART IN HARDWARE

*ASCII art* is a graphic design technique that uses computer characters for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from some printable characters defined by the ASCII Standard. However, this requires a lot of simple calculations and therefore consumes high amounts of computer resources. For this reason, these tasks can be done better with *shaders*. 

## Problem statement
Create an image composed solely of ASCII characters that looks like the original image using shaders.
